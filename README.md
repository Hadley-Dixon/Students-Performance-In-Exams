# Students Performance In Exams
Semester Project, Dec 2022

* Objective *

Each of the projects written below are computational tasks that will require tools 
from what you’ve learned in this course. The aim of this final project is to provide 
everyone in the class useful computational tools in R. A major component of this 
project is to make any code efficient, well-documented, and easy to use. Also any 
plots or output should be crisp, easily understood, and properly labeled. 
You can use some code from online resources but do not simply copy and paste 
some one else’s code for the entire product. If you are having trouble finding a 
data set, you may use data from repositories such as http://archive. ics.uci.edu/ml/. 
Be creative! Don’t use pre-loaded data in R. 

* What to Turn In *

A write-up that is done in an R markdown file (that has been knit and saved 
as a .pdf) that answers all the questions in the “Components” section below. 
You  must  print  any  plots  and  show  the  code  for  anything  necessary  to 
answer the questions. 

A  15  minute  presentation  (cannot  go  over  15  minutes!),  which  will  be 
presented on either Monday, December 5th or Wednesday, December 7th. In 
your  presentation,  include  a  summary  /  discussion  of  everything  in  the 
“Components” section below. This does not mean to show all plots, rather, 
give a presentation that conveys the message and the details of what you 
would present in a business meeting. Imagine you have one shot to speak in 
front of a CEO of a company that wants to know what you’ve been working 
on. 

* Components of the write-up and presentation *

Statement of question/topic that you want to answer and what motivated 
you to study the question/topic. 

If applicable, what data will you analyze? Identify at least one data source 
(can be from Kaggle, etc.) 

What challenges do you face in analyzing this data? 

What packages were needed for this case study? 

Discussion: What did you learn from this experience? What more could you 
do with this project in the future? 

* Description *

[Case  Study]  Choose  your  favorite  data  set  or  one  from  a  Kaggle 
competition at Kaggle.com to which you can apply computation techniques 
in R described in class. Discuss the challenges in the problem and the data 
set,  and  how  you  circumvented  these  problems.  Consider  issues  of,  for 
example, sparsity in the features and response, high dimensions, and the 
scalability issues of BIG data. For any problem, apply any method that you 
see  appropriate  and  discuss  the  advantages  and  disadvantages  of  each 
method  and  why  you  found  them  appropriate.  Thoroughly  explore  and 
assess any inference that you make on the data and what lead to your 
analysis. In your presentation, explain the data, why it interested you, and 
your step-by-step analyses that lead to any final conclusions.
