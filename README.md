## Objective
The aim of this final project is to provide everyone in the class useful computational tools in R. A major component of this project is to make any code efficient, well-documented, and easy to use. Also any plots or output should be crisp, easily understood, and properly labeled.

## Assignment
• Awrite-upthatisdoneinanRmarkdownfile(thathasbeenknitandsaved as a .pdf) that answers all the questions in the “Components” section below. You must print any plots and show the code for anything necessary to answer the questions.
• A 15 minute presentation (cannot go over 15 minutes!), which will be presented on either Monday, December 5th or Wednesday, December 7th. In your presentation, include a summary / discussion of everything in the “Components” section below. This does not mean to show all plots, rather, give a presentation that conveys the message and the details of what you would present in a business meeting. Imagine you have one shot to speak in front of a CEO of a company that wants to know what you’ve been working on.

## Due Dates
• The presentation (a .ppt or .pdf)
• The write-up

## Components of the write-up and presentation
• Statement of question/topic that you want to answer and what motivated you to study the question/topic.
• If applicable, what data will you analyze?I dentify at least one data source (can be from Kaggle, etc.)
• What challenges do you face in analyzing this data?
• What packages were needed for this case study?
• Discussion: What did you learn from this experience? What more could you do with this project in the future?

## Grading
Grading will be done as follows. This is based on a 100 point maximum.
• The presentation is worth 30 points and the write-up is worth 30 points. For this, each of the components to be included in the write-up and presentation is worth 6 points a piece.
• Having an R markdown that has knitted - worth 15 points
• Having a clear, concise report and presentation. For example, no extraneous plots, no going over 15 minutes for a presentation. - worth 15 points.
• Being present for all presentations and contributing to the presentation for your group - worth 10 points.

## Project Choices
The goal of this project is to research the topic chosen from above, present and implement at least one method in this area. Describe the topic, any challenges inherent in the area, and relationships with other topics that we have covered in the class. Apply your chosen method(s) to a data set of your choice, including any analyses and data-driven decisions from machine learning that can help you analyze the data. Remember you are the instructor of this topic, so present in a way that you wish someone would have taught you.
• [Case Study] Choose your favorite data set or one from a Kaggle competition at Kaggle.com to which you can apply computation techniques in R described in class. Discuss the challenges in the problem and the data set, and how you circumvented these problems. Consider issues of, for example, sparsity in the features and response, high dimensions, and the scalability issues of BIG data. For any problem, apply any method that you see appropriate and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each method and why you found them appropriate. Thoroughly explore and assess any inference that you make on the data and what lead to your analysis. In your presentation, explain the data, why it interested you, and your step-by-step analyses that lead to any final conclusions.
